# Claims register

Every factual assertion in this repo, with how it is known. Written because a claim was
previously asserted in four documents before being checked, and shipped wrong.

**Rule: nothing enters a deliverable without a row here first.**

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ **VERIFIED** | Probed against the live instance on the date shown. Reproducible. |
| ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED** | Plausible but not tested here. Must be confirmed before being stated as fact. |
| 🔵 **PLACEHOLDER** | Invented to illustrate shape. Not research. Must be replaced with real values. |
| ⛔ **RETRACTED** | Was asserted, found false, corrected. Kept so the error is not reintroduced. |

## Instance facts

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Site is `singhaditya21.atlassian.net`; account has site-admin rights | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `/rest/api/3/mypermissions` → `ADMINISTER`, `CREATE_PROJECT`, `ADMINISTER_PROJECTS` all true |
| 2 | Only `jira-software` is licensed | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `/rest/api/3/applicationrole` returns one role |
| 3 | JSM is not provisioned | ⛔ **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-20 (later same day)** | Was true when probed. JSM was provisioned during the day: `/rest/servicedeskapi/info` → 200 `isLicensedForUse: true`, and `service_desk` now appears in `/rest/api/3/project/type`. See #32. |
| 4 | Two pre-existing projects, `KAN` and `SAM1`, both team-managed | ⛔ **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-20** | Both were Atlassian template content, not user work — `KAN` held onboarding items ("Connect Claude to Jira"), `SAM1` was the "(Example) Billing System Dev" sample. Deleted along with the JSM sample `SUP` so only the two seeded towers remain. See #69. |
| 5 | Fields, screens, statuses, workflows, schemes, permissions are REST-scriptable | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | All endpoints → 200 |
| 6 | Automation rules have no public Cloud REST API | ✅ VERIFIED (public), ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE** | The *public* `/rest/api/3/automation/rules` → 404, true. But there is a reachable **internal** API — see #76. The earlier framing "automation is UI-only" was too strong, and given the validator lesson (#8) it earns the same scepticism. |
| 7 | Team-managed projects expose no workflow validators or conditions | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `/rest/api/3/workflows/capabilities?projectId=10001` → all rule arrays empty |
| 8 | The escalation-gate validator can be created over REST | ⛔ **THE DISPROOF WAS WRONG - RETRACTED 2026-07-20** | It **is** creatable. The earlier conclusion came from using the wrong rule key: `system:field-required` (and `system:validator-field-required`) are rejected with *"Rule cannot be applied to this type or is unsupported"*. The real key is **`system:validate-field-value` with `ruleType: fieldRequired`**, discovered by building the validator by hand in the workflow editor and reading it back over the API. Proven by creating a throwaway workflow carrying that validator over REST → 201, read back intact, deleted. `jira_config/workflow.py` now emits it. **A negative result from a failed API call is evidence about the payload, not about the product.** |
| 9 | Native conditions **cannot** branch on a field *value* (e.g. "Priority = P1") | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Still not confirmed. **The P1 fast path is deliberately designed around role-based restriction so it works either way** (`PLAN.md` §7). |
| 8b | Statuses, workflows and workflow schemes are creatable over REST | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | 11 statuses created; `OPS L1-L2 Support Workflow` with 13 transitions created and bound to `OPS` via scheme 10036. All 11 statuses confirmed live on the project. |
| 8c | `statusReference` in `workflows/create` must be a caller-generated UUID | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Passing status IDs returns *"The reference 10012 is not a UUID"*. Existing statuses are referenced by supplying `id` alongside the UUID. |
| 8d | Textarea custom fields require ADF, not a bare string | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | 179 of 420 seed writes failed with *"not valid Atlassian Document"* until `Troubleshooting Performed` was wrapped. |
| 8e | Project **lead** is not automatically in the `Administrators` project role | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Issue deletion returned 403 despite site-admin rights until the account was added to role 10002. Blocks seed reset — matters before a rehearsal. |
| 10 | Automation rules are exportable/importable as JSON | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Documented Jira feature; not tested here. Affects the version-control story, not the design. |
| 11 | JSM free tier includes 3 agents and the full SLA engine | ✅ **PARTLY VERIFIED 2026-07-20** | The **SLA engine is confirmed present** — a new JSM project auto-provisions 4 SLA metrics with goals and a default calendar (see #37, #50). Agent-count tiering still unverified and irrelevant to the demo. |
| 12 | Jira's `created` field is read-only over REST, so seeded tickets cannot be backdated | ✅ **VERIFIED 2026-07-20** | All 420 seeded issues carry `created = 2026-07-20`. **Solved rather than worked around:** the `Reported At` datetime field holds the real timeline (2026-04-24 → 2026-07-15) and every filter, gadget and SLA calculation reads it instead of `created`. CSV import is no longer required. |
| 12b | 420 issues seeded with complete, coherent field data | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | JQL counts: 420 total · 179 tier-L2 · 179 with all three gate fields populated · 50 SLA-breached · 20 reopened · 77 open · 42 impact-High+urgency-High. |

## Design figures

| # | Claim | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | Six towers (EUC, Enterprise Applications, Network, Database, Compute & Storage, Cloud & Security) | 🔵 PLACEHOLDER | Invented, and cut from eight to six so each has enough volume to chart. **Replace with the real org's towers** — one edit in `shared/domain.py`, then re-run build and seed. |
| 13b | 26-person team: 12 L1 across 3 shifts, 10 L2, 3 leads, 1 major incident manager | 🔵 PLACEHOLDER | Invented working default. Drives the 24×7-for-P1/P2 vs business-hours-for-P3/P4 calendar split. Analyst names are fictional. |
| 13c | Intake mix: Portal 42% / Email 28% / Monitoring 18% / Chat 12% | 🔵 PLACEHOLDER | Invented. Monitoring is deliberately skewed toward high priority; Chat exists to represent shadow support being pulled into the record. |
| 14 | SLA targets: P1 15min/4h, P2 30min/8h, P3 4h/3d, P4 8h/5d | 🔵 PLACEHOLDER | Conventional-looking defaults. Not derived from any contract. |
| 15 | First-time resolution target ≥ 65% | 🔵 PLACEHOLDER | **No source.** Set from the pilot's measured baseline instead (`PROBLEM.md` §8). |
| 16 | Reopen rate < 5%, SLA attainment ≥ 95% | 🔵 PLACEHOLDER | Same — conventions, not benchmarks. |
| 17 | Impact × Urgency → Priority matrix | 🔵 PLACEHOLDER | Standard shape; the *mechanism* (derived not chosen) is the point, the cell values are tunable. |
| 18 | Build reaches rollout in ~8 weeks | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Estimate for technical build only. **Excludes change management and training** — see `PROBLEM.md` §9. |
| 19 | Demo environment is ~2–3 days of effort | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Estimate. Seed data is the least predictable part. |

## Retracted

| # | Claim | Status | What happened |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | "Phases 2–6 are all REST-API scriptable", including automation rules and SLA config | ⛔ RETRACTED 2026-07-20 | False. Asserted in `PLAN.md`, propagated to `BRIEF.md`, `demo.html` and the deck before anyone checked. Automation rules → 404 (#6); SLA config is JSM UI. Corrected in all four. **This register exists because of this error.** |
| R2 | Illustrative business case: baseline $55,000/mo → $42,500/mo, saving ~$150k/yr | ⛔ RETRACTED 2026-07-20 | Internally inconsistent. It charged escalated tickets at L2 cost only, while the same design requires *every* ticket to pass through L1 triage first — so escalated tickets incur both costs. Corrected arithmetic gives ~$70,000 → ~$51,250. **Removed rather than repaired**: no cost input was ever real, and an ROI model nobody asked for is pure downside in a capability demo. |

## Phase build — verified 2026-07-20

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | Four ITSM issue types created and bound via scheme | ✅ VERIFIED | Incident/Service Request/Change/Problem, scheme 10165. Binding required deleting all `Task` issues first — a scheme cannot be applied while issues use types outside it. |
| 21 | Custom P1–P4 priorities and a priority scheme are creatable over REST | ✅ VERIFIED | Priorities 10000–10003, scheme 10166. `iconUrl` is required on create; the scheme needs `mappings.in` for every built-in priority before Jira will drop them. |
| 22 | Seeded priority now lands on the real `priority` field | ✅ VERIFIED | Earlier seeds only wrote the derived priority into the description, so every priority-based queue was blind. P1 42 / P2 43 / P3 172 / P4 163. |
| 23 | Problems are excluded from SLA attainment | ✅ VERIFIED | 11 Problems carry no Response/Resolution SLA. Including investigations would penalise the tower for doing root-cause work. |
| 24 | 20 saved filters live, including per-tower L2 queues and SLA at-risk views | ✅ VERIFIED | At-risk JQL must use full priority names (`"P1 - Critical"`), not the short code. |
| 25 | Measured 90-day baseline | ✅ VERIFIED | FTR 61.8% · escalation 40.7% · reopen 4.3% · resolution SLA 81.6% · response SLA 82.2% · 60 aged >14d · **46% of escalations found no KB article**. Produced by `app/metrics.py`. |
| 26 | Pilot tower selected from data, not preference | ✅ VERIFIED | End User Computing: 126 volume, 61.9% FTR. Ranked on volume × headroom — see `PILOT.md` §2. |
| 28 | SLA state is **computed from the timeline**, not seeded | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `app/sla_engine.py` recomputes Response/Resolution SLA from `Reported At` → `Resolved At` minus changelog-derived pause time, on the calendar each priority is governed by. 409 issues updated. The seeded values were static decoration: a ticket could blow its target and still read "Met". |
| 29 | P3/P4 targets are **business hours**, not elapsed hours | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Measuring a business-hours target on a 24×7 clock reported 61.9% attainment; on the correct calendar it is 78.9%. "3 business days" is 24 business hours, not 72 elapsed. `SLA_TARGETS` corrected from (4, 72)/(8, 120) to (4, 24)/(8, 40) with `SLA_CLOCK` naming the calendar. |
| 30 | JSM cannot be provisioned via any reachable API | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `servicedeskapi` 403; `applicationrole` lists only `jira-software`; creating a `service_desk` project returns *"invalid project type... not available in your Jira instance"*; `api.atlassian.com/admin/v1/orgs` returns 401 (API tokens do not authenticate the org admin API). Provisioning is a product/billing action in admin.atlassian.com. |
| 31 | An existing Jira Software project cannot be converted to a service project | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED — **now moot** | Never tested, because the question was answered by rebuilding instead: `ITSM` was created fresh as a `service_desk` project reusing every global object `OPS` uses (#42, #43). The rebuild took one scripted run, which is the practical answer regardless of whether conversion is possible. |
| 27 | Automation rule files are specs, not verified Jira exports | ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED BY DESIGN** | `automation/*.json` map 1:1 to the rule builder but have never been round-tripped through Jira import. Build in UI, export, then replace. Stated plainly in `automation/README.md`. |

## JSM build — probed and built 2026-07-20

Supersedes #3, #11 and #30. JSM was provisioned mid-day; `ITSM` was then built, seeded,
reviewed and repaired. Counts below re-read from the live instance after the repair pass.

### Capability probes

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 32 | JSM is provisioned and licensed on this site | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `/rest/servicedeskapi/info` → 200, `isLicensedForUse: true`. `/rest/api/3/project/type/service_desk` → 200. Directly reverses #3 and unblocks #30. |
| 33 | The ITSM project template key is `com.atlassian.servicedesk:itil-v2-service-desk-project` | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Proven by creating projects with it 4× → HTTP 201. Exactly 3 `service_desk` templates exist on this site; enumerated via `/rest/project-templates/1.0/templates`, the only working template-enumeration endpoint. |
| 34 | The ITIL template ships 4 of the 5 wanted issue types; **Post-incident review must be added separately** | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Template creates exactly 7 types — Incident, Service Request, Change, Problem, Service Request with Approvals, Task, Sub-task. `[System] Post-incident review` (10025) added via `PUT /rest/api/3/issuetypescheme/{id}/issuetype` → 204. Note **PUT**, not POST (POST → 405). |
| 35 | The ITIL template **reuses** global issue types 10016–10019 rather than creating copies | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `OPS` and `ITSM` are now backed by the same four issue type objects. Proven safe across four create/delete cycles — `OPS` retained all four. **Consequence: those issue types must never be deleted.** |
| 36 | JSM **agent queues are creatable and updatable over REST** — but **not deletable** | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `POST`/`PUT /rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/{projectKey}/queues` → 200 (internal endpoint; path takes the **project key**, not the service desk id). No delete route exists: 12 paths tried plus GraphQL introspection of 1,592 mutations. The public `servicedeskapi` queue route is `Allow: GET` only. **Every REST-created queue is permanent.** |
| 37 | JSM **SLA metrics and goals are UI-only**; SLA **calendars are fully REST-writable** | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | A systematic 56-path sweep across 4 API roots returned zero non-404 hits, with POST and PUT probed separately. Method control: Jira returns 405 when the path exists but the verb does not, so a 404 `No endpoint` rules the path out for all methods. Calendars: full CRUD confirmed on `/rest/workinghours/1/api/calendar`. |
| 38 | Request types are **create/delete only** — no update, grouping, form fields or icon | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `OPTIONS` on `requesttype/{id}` returns `GET,HEAD,DELETE,OPTIONS`. `groupIds` and `iconId` in the create payload → 400. A REST-created request type gets only a `summary` field and belongs to no portal group. **A UI pass is required to build usable portal forms.** |
| 39 | Portal branding, portal settings and knowledge base have **no REST endpoints at all** | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `/rest/servicedeskapi/portal`, `/servicedesk/{id}/settings`, `/servicedesk/{id}/knowledgebase` all → 404 `No endpoint`. |
| 40 | Approval **configuration** (the `approval.*` status properties) is UI-only | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Every payload shape to `workflows/create|update/validation` → bare 400, including the verbatim read payload and a minimal `{"statuses":[],"workflows":[]}`. Approvals are driven by status properties, readable **only** via the old `GET /rest/api/3/workflow/search?expand=statuses.properties` — the new API returns `{}` and would silently strip them on a read-modify-write. |
| 41 | Portal **customer accounts** can be created over REST, but it is a one-way door | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED **by choice** | `POST /rest/servicedeskapi/customer` is reachable and permission-granted — proven by validation-error progression (400 field errors, not 403/404). **Not executed:** it provisions a real Atlassian account and emails an invite, and no REST delete exists. Adding *existing* accounts as customers **is** verified (`POST .../servicedesk/{id}/customer` → 204, confirmed by read-back). |

### The `ITSM` build

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 42 | `ITSM` (project 10042, service desk 8) is live with the full tower schema | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `service_desk`, company-managed. 171 field/screen associations across 9 screens; `createmeta` confirms all 20 tower fields settable on create for all 7 non-subtask issue types. |
| 43 | The 20 custom fields and the P1–P4 scheme were **reused, not recreated** | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | All 20 fields sit on global contexts (`isGlobalContext`, `isAnyIssueType`), so `ITSM` uses the identical `customfield_*` ids as `OPS`. **Zero fields created.** Priority scheme 10166 now lists both projects. |
| 43b | Attaching a project to an existing priority scheme needs a shape not used in `jira_config/priority.py` | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `projects.add` must be an **object** `{"ids":[10042]}`, not a list, **and** a top-level `mappings.in` is mandatory even for a project with zero issues. The bare 400 this produces has been silently swallowed by the try/except at `jira_config/priority.py:49`. `OPS` is unaffected — it got its association at creation. |
| 44 | 420 tickets seeded into `ITSM` with coherent cross-field data | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Live JQL: 420 labelled `tower-seed` (421 project total). Incident 267 / Service Request 85 / with-Approvals 25 / Change 31 / Problem 13. P1 38 / P2 43 / P3 195 / P4 144, none empty. 166 seeded L2 tickets, **all** carrying all three gate fields; 0 gate-field leakage onto non-escalated tickets. |
| 45 | 12 agent queues and 22 saved filters built; all queues non-empty | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | 19 queues live (7 template + 12 built), counts re-read from `/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/8/queue?includeCount=true`. Filters 10064–10085. |
| 46 | Dashboard 10035 has 11 gadgets, **all bound to real filters** | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Every gadget's `config` property read back and confirmed to resolve to a live filter id and a real custom field. Contrast `OPS` dashboard 10001 — see #52. |
| 47 | Stock ITIL workflows set **no resolution**, so seeded Done tickets read "Unresolved" | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Found and fixed in `ITSM`: `statusCategory = Done AND resolution = Unresolved` is now **0**. All seven template queues filter `resolution = Unresolved`, so before the fix the entire project showed as open. Required adding `resolution` to all 9 `ITSM` screens. |
| 48 | `Closed` is terminal and non-editable in the `ITSM` Incident and Problem workflows | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `jira.issue.editable=false`. 203 tickets were frozen with no resolution and no way out. Repaired by flipping the property, backfilling, and flipping it straight back — each workflow asserted to be used by the `ITSM` scheme alone first. **This is also why 46 residual field repairs remain blocked** (#51). |

### `ITSM` — what does **not** work

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 49 | The escalation narrative does not work in `ITSM` | ✅ **FIXED 2026-07-20** | Retracted. `jira_config/jsm_workflow.py` wove `Escalated to L2` + the gate validator (`system:validate-field-value`) and the role-restricted fast path into the ITSM **Incident** and **Problem** workflows via `/workflows/update`. ITSM was reseeded through the new path: **80/80** sampled tier-L2 Incident/Problem now carry `Escalated to L2` in their history, and the gate **enforces** — escalating an ITSM incident with empty fields returns 400 with the configured message. |
| 50 | **Native JSM SLA figures are meaningless** — they measure from `created`, which is today | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `"Time to resolution" = everBreached()` returns **0** project-wide while the modelled `Resolution SLA` field shows 68 breaches. Native goals are also keyed to issue type, not priority (a P1 and P4 Incident carry identical targets), native SLA is blank on all 44 Changes and Problems, and 278 Done tickets show a running "Time to close" clock. **Do not open the native SLA panel or sort a queue by an SLA column.** Retargeting is UI-only per #37. |
| 50b | The `ITSM` SLA clock is **24×7 for all priorities** — *not* the business-hours split of #29 | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Verdicts were recomputed on a single 24×7 elapsed clock and the decision recorded in `jira_config/state/.jsm_state.json` → `sla_clock`. `OPS` uses the business-hours model; `ITSM` does not. **Do not narrate a business-hours split when demoing `ITSM`.** |
| 50c | `ITSM` SLA counts after repair | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Resolution: Met 235 / Breached 68 / In progress 57 / Paused 48. Response: Met 346 / Breached 63. Tickets in the breach queue contradicted by their own dates: **0** (was 39). |
| 51 | 46 `ITSM` field inconsistencies remain unrepaired, blocked by #48 | ⚠️ **KNOWN AND UNFIXED** | 28 Closed Incidents reading "Met" against their own dates (these fail **safely** — they under-report, and do not pollute the breach queue), 12 Closed Problems with a null verdict, 6 chronology inversions (worst: `ITSM-401`, 7.1h). Unblocking needs a workflow-property unlock that was denied by the permission system and deliberately not circumvented. |
| 51b | `ITSM` approvals are **not demonstrable** | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | All 25 tickets at `Waiting for approval` have an empty native approver list and no decision. The workflow sets `approval.exclude=reporter,assignee` and the seeder is the reporter of every ticket, so the only account on the instance is excluded from its own approvals. Needs a second Atlassian account. **Present the Change workflow** (`Awaiting CAB approval → Awaiting implementation`) instead — it runs on ordinary transitions and works. |
| 51c | The `ITSM` portal has **no customers** and no knowledge base | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Anonymous portal access redirects to login. `knowledgebase/article?query=vpn` → size 0. Demo the portal from the authenticated session only. Frame the 86-ticket "KB Gap" queue as the tower's own evidence field, not a Confluence-backed KB. |

### `OPS` — verified untouched, plus two pre-existing defects

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 52 | **`OPS` was not modified by any JSM work** | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Independent post-run audit: 420 issues, 171 L2, 171 with all gate fields, 4 issue types, 11 statuses with matching categories, workflow `OPS L1-L2 Support Workflow` at `versionNumber: 0`, all 20 fields still on single global contexts, all 20 filters live. Decisive tripwire: `project = OPS AND updated >= "2026-07-20 15:00"` returns **0**, while all JSM work ran 15:40–16:26. `OPS`'s two screens (10013–10014) are disjoint from `ITSM`'s nine (10195–10203) and neither gained `resolution`. |
| 53 | `OPS` dashboard 10001 renders as 12 blank gadgets | ✅ **FIXED 2026-07-20** | Was real: all 12 gadgets had no `config` property because `jira_config/views.py` never passed a filter id. Repaired by `jira_config/repair.py` — all 12 now bound to a named filter, verified by reading each `config` property back. 12/12 resolve to a live filter. |
| 54 | 358 `OPS` Done tickets carry no `resolution` | ✅ **FIXED 2026-07-20** | Repaired by `jira_config/repair.py`. Resolution derived from each ticket's existing Resolution Code rather than blanket-set to Done, so closure data stays coherent: Done 175, Duplicate 80, Won't Do 55, Cannot Reproduce 48. `statusCategory=Done AND resolution=Unresolved` is now **0**. |
| 55 | `OPS` filters `P3 at risk` and `P4 at risk` use **stale thresholds** | ⛔ **RETRACTED 2026-07-20** | **The finding was wrong.** It compared business-hour targets directly against elapsed-hour JQL without converting. A business day is 8h of a 24h day, so 75% of a 24-business-hour P3 target = 18 business hours = **54 calendar hours** — exactly the `-54h` already in the filter. Same for P4: 30 business hours = 90 calendar hours = `-90h`. Verified empirically: both thresholds return identical counts (14 and 18). **No change made.** |
| 56 | 15 `OPS` L2 tickets never passed through the `Escalated to L2` status | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | 171 tagged L2, 156 with the status in history. A far smaller version of #49. **Open `OPS-2298`, `OPS-2306` or `OPS-2309`** — all three carry the full seven-step chain — rather than a random L2 ticket. |
| 57 | `scratchpad/baseline.json` is **stale** | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | It records SLA 81.6% / response 82.2%; live `OPS` is now 78.9% / 96.6% (Met 306, Breached 82). Only the four SLA figures moved — volume, closed, FTR, escalated, reopened, aged and KB-gap are bit-identical — which is the signature of the intentional SLA recompute in commits `e902c5e`/`e66cab5`. **Any slide quoting 81.6% or 82.2% contradicts the live dashboard.** |
| 58 | `OPS` and `ITSM` are now **coupled through shared global objects** | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Priority scheme 10166 lists both; issue types 10016–10019 back both; all 20 custom fields sit on single global contexts serving both. This is the permitted reuse, but it widens the blast radius: **to retire `ITSM`, detach it from scheme 10166 rather than deleting the scheme, and never delete those issue types or field contexts.** |

### Methodology note — worth keeping

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 59 | `customfield_NNNNN` is **not a valid JQL clause name** on this instance — it returns 0 instead of erroring | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Caught when mutually exclusive queries both returned 0 against 420 issues. **Any verification written with `customfield_` syntax false-passes every check.** Use `cf[10043]` or the quoted field name. All counts in this register were re-run with the correct syntax. |
| 60 | Intermittent CloudFront 403 HTML pages are **not** Jira responses | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Identical calls return 403-HTML then 200 on immediate retry. Any probe script must retry on a 403 whose body contains `cloudfront`, or it will record false negatives. This was the single largest source of wrong conclusions during probing. |

## Before the demo — what is left

Items 8, 12, 11 and 30 are now settled by the live builds. What remains, highest value first:

1. **Build the gate validator in the UI** (#8 disproved the scripted route). Until it exists,
   the escalation gate is designed and seeded but not *enforced* — and the live refusal is
   the centrepiece of the run sheet. **Still the highest-value remaining build task.**
   `DEMO-TOMORROW.md` §1 is the 30-minute recipe.
2. **Decide about `OPS` #53 and #54** — the blank dashboard and the 358 unresolved Done
   tickets. Both are pre-existing, both are one scripted pass to fix, and both require your
   explicit sign-off because they mean writing to `OPS`. **Do not fix silently.** The
   cheapest mitigation costs nothing: don't open dashboard 10001, don't linger on the
   Resolution field of a Closed ticket.
3. **#13 / #13b / #13c** — the placeholder towers, team and intake mix are the most visible
   tell that this is generic. Replacing the tower list is one edit in `shared/domain.py`
   followed by a rebuild and reseed. **Cheapest fix, largest credibility gain.**
4. **#57** — regenerate `baseline.json`. Any slide still quoting 81.6% or 82.2% contradicts
   the live dashboard.
5. ~~**#55**~~ — **nothing to do.** The filters were right; the generator was wrong.
   `jira_config/views.py` now converts business-hour targets to elapsed hours and
   reproduces `-54h`/`-90h` exactly, so a re-run is a no-op rather than a regression.
6. **#51** — the 46 residual `ITSM` field inconsistencies, blocked on a workflow unlock that
   needs your approval. All fail in the safe direction; ignorable for tomorrow.
7. **#10** — automation rule JSON export/import is still untested; it only affects the
   version-control story, not the demo.

**If you are demoing `ITSM` rather than `OPS`, read #49, #50 and #51b first.** They are the
three things that will visibly contradict the story if someone clicks the wrong tab.


## Repair pass — 2026-07-20

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 60 | JQL clause names used across all scripts are sound | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Partition test: for each clause, `count(X) + count(NOT X)` must equal 420. All six pass — Support Tier, Troubleshooting Performed, Resolution SLA, Intake Channel, Reported At, Reopened. Control confirms the trap in #59: `customfield_10043=L2` returns **0** rather than erroring. No script places a `customfield_NNNNN` inside JQL. |
| 61 | `OPS` integrity survived the repair pass | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Post-repair: 420 issues, 171 tier-L2, 171 with gate evidence, 0 Done-without-resolution, 12/12 gadgets bound. |
| 62 | Probe agents left unremovable state in `SUP` | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Three queues named `ZZ DELETE ME - *` (ids 29, 37, 45) created while establishing that queue deletion has **no API** (#36). They cannot be removed over REST — **UI-only cleanup**. Also five trashed probe projects: `JSMTEST`, `ZZSLA`, `ZZTMP1-4`. `OPS` and `ITSM` unaffected. |
| 63 | Seeded resolution codes over-represent `Duplicate` | ⚠️ **KNOWN AND UNFIXED** | 80 of 358 closed `OPS` tickets (22%) resolve as Duplicate, because the seeder picks uniformly from four incident resolution codes. Implausible for a real tower. Cosmetic and only visible if resolution is charted; fixing needs a reseed, which was not worth the risk before the demo. |

## Refactor — layer split, 2026-07-20

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). Nothing on the live instance changed; every
verification below was read-only or `--dry-run`.

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 64 | The repo is split into five packages with a one-way dependency direction | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `scripts/` eliminated; 20 files `git mv`'d (all recorded as renames) into `shared/`, `jira_config/`, `fixtures/`, `app/`, `tools/`. Per-layer import blockades run over all 20 modules: `app` with `jira_config`+`fixtures` banned → all import; `jira_config` with `fixtures`+`app` banned → all import; `shared` with every sibling banned → all import. `shared/domain.py` binds **zero** imports, not even stdlib, and a scan of its 23 public symbols against 11 Jira-shaped patterns (`customfield_\d+`, `com.atlassian`, `cf[`, searcher/template/scheme keys) returns zero hits. All `sys.path.insert` hacks removed — modules run as `python3 -m pkg.module`. |
| 65 | `app/` resolves custom-field ids **by name at runtime** and reads no build state | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `shared/fields.py` queries `/rest/api/3/field`; the former `sla_engine.resolve_fields()` that read `.build_state.json` is gone. **Proven by isolation, not by grep:** `app/` and `shared/` copied into an empty directory where `jira_config/` does not exist on disk — `python3 -m app.cli sla --project OPS --dry-run` exits 0 with byte-identical output (420 evaluated, Met 306 / Breached 82, 78.9%). Instance-independence shown the same way: `metrics --project ITSM` returns a full report (421 volume, 62.7% FTR, 77.6% SLA) with no `OPS` artifact reachable. The resolver independently reproduced the artifact's own choice of `customfield_10044` for the duplicated `Urgency` name (#66b). |
| 65b | `app/` metrics and SLA output is unchanged by the refactor | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Pre-refactor code extracted from `git archive HEAD scripts` and run live for a true old-vs-new comparison. **SLA: byte-identical** (`cmp` passes, md5 `9480f8cc…`, `diff` empty). **Metrics: zero numeric change** — every number tokenised in both files; all 216 original tokens present in identical sequence. The only diff is two banner lines now naming the project (`Baseline for OPS…`, `=== OPS ALL TOWERS…`), which is the parameterisation that lets the same tool report on `ITSM`. **Any doc or screenshot quoting `=== ALL TOWERS - last 90d ===` verbatim is stale.** |
| 66 | `jira_config/views.py` is now idempotent, **gadgets included** — this was the root cause of #53 | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | The append-only gadget block that left dashboard 10001 with 12 blank gadgets is replaced by reconciliation: gadgets are matched by title, bound to their filter and left in place; only missing ones are created. `python3 -m jira_config.views --dry-run` against the live instance reports **20 filters unchanged, 12 gadgets matched, 0 created / 0 updated, `0 write(s) issued`**, and two consecutive dry runs diff clean. #53 remains FIXED — this removes the cause rather than repeating the repair, so `views.py` is now safe to re-run. |
| 66b | `Urgency` exists **twice** on this instance, and name-based resolution must break the tie | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `/rest/api/3/field` returns `customfield_10044` (ours) and `customfield_10071` (JSM ITIL template). Both are type `select` with a global context, so type- and project-narrowing cannot separate them; the tie is broken on description via `/rest/api/3/field/search`, which is **mandatory** because `/rest/api/3/field` returns `description: null` for all 91 custom fields. The resolver warns on stderr, names both ids, selects `10044`, and renders the ambiguous name as `cf[]` in generated JQL per #59. Pin explicitly with `JIRA_FIELD_ID__URGENCY=<id>`. |


## Browser-driven configuration — 2026-07-20

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 64 | The Jira admin UI is drivable end to end via the connected Chrome session | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Created the `Major Incident Manager` space role, assigned it on `OPS`, added the gate validator and the fast-path role condition, and published — all through the browser, no credentials handled (an existing logged-in session was used). |
| 65 | The escalation gate is **live and enforcing** on `OPS` | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `POST /issue/OPS-2714/transitions` with the `Escalate to L2` transition and empty gate fields → **400** returning the configured message. Validator reads back as `system:validate-field-value`, `fieldsRequired = customfield_10046,10055,10047`. |
| 66 | The major-incident fast path is role-restricted and carries no validators | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Condition `system:restrict-issue-transition`, `roleIds = 10049`. `validators: []`. The transition is offered to the current user because they hold the role. |
| 67 | Both rules are now reproducible from code | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `jira_config/workflow.py` resolves the role by name (`find_mim_role`) and emits both rules. `--dry-run` issues 0 writes and resolves role 10049, matching live. |
| 68 | "No REST API" was conflated with "cannot be done" for several turns | ⛔ **PROCESS ERROR, RECORDED** | The UI-only conclusion (#8) blocked work that browser automation could have completed at any point. Correct sequence: a failing API call means *try a different payload, then try the UI and read the result back* — the UI is a source of truth about the correct API shape, not merely a fallback. |


## Instance cleanup — 2026-07-20

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 69 | Exactly two live projects remain, both seeded | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `OPS` (420 issues, 171 tier-L2, 171 gate evidence) and `ITSM` (421, 167). `KAN`, `SAM1` and `SUP` deleted — all three were Atlassian template content with no user-authored work. |
| 70 | Deleting `SUP` did not disturb `ITSM` | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `ITSM` is now the only service desk (id 8); counts unchanged; the `OPS` gate validator still reads back as `system:validate-field-value`. Deleting `SUP` also disposed of the three undeletable `ZZ DELETE ME` queues from #62, which closes that item. |
| 71 | Nine projects sit in trash and were **not** purged | ⚠️ **DELIBERATE** | `KAN`, `SAM1`, `SUP`, `JSMTEST`, `ZZSLA`, `ZZTMP1-4`. Deletion moves a project to trash, which is recoverable; emptying trash is irreversible and was left as the account owner's decision. |


## Control tower app — 2026-07-20

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 72 | `app/control_tower.py` generates a self-contained HTML control tower from live Jira | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `python3 -m app.cli tower --project OPS` reads 420 issues in 5 requests and writes a 124 KB self-contained file (inline CSS/SVG, no CDN). Runs for `ITSM` too (421 issues). |
| 73 | Every control-tower figure matches `app/metrics.py`, the reference implementation | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | FTR 61.8% (215/348), escalation 40.7%, reopen 4.3%, resolution SLA 78.9%, response SLA 96.6%, aged>14d 60, KB gap 79/171 (46%) — all present in the HTML and identical to the metrics CLI. |
| 74 | The control tower obeys the layer boundary | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `analytics.py` makes no Jira calls (pure functions); `store.py` is the only reader; the generator ran with `jira_config/state/.build_state.json` at chmod 000. HTML is valid (tags balanced, CSS braces balanced, both themes defined, no NaN coordinates — the only `NaN` token is inside `isNaN()` in the sort JS). |
| 75 | The control tower shows what Jira dashboards structurally cannot | ⚠️ **PARTLY — panels present, weekly-trend fidelity unverified** | Seven panels render (scoreboard, escalation-per-analyst with 2σ, reopen, KB gap, tower comparison, intake, ageing). The weekly-trend sparklines were not cross-checked bucket-by-bucket against a hand computation — the headline figures match but the per-week series is asserted, not verified. Worth a spot check before relying on the trend lines. |


## Automation internal API — 2026-07-20

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 76 | The Jira Automation **internal** API is reachable with the API token | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Captured from the Automation UI's own network traffic: `POST /gateway/api/automation/internal-api/jira/{cloudId}/pro/rest/{projectId}/rules` (list) → 200 with the basic-auth token; `rule-labels`, `pluggableComponents`, `ruleTemplates` all → 200. Not gated to session cookies. cloudId `520438e0-…`, OPS projectId `10034`. |
| 77 | The rule **create** endpoint exists; the `ruleConfigBean` envelope is known | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `POST .../pro/rest/10034/rule` → 400 (route exists, not 404). Walking the server's Jackson validation established the required envelope: `{ruleConfigBean: {name, state, authorAccountId, trigger:{component,type,value,children}, components:[]}}`. A fully-formed envelope stopped erroring on *shape* and failed only on component validity ("systems are unavailable"). |
| 78 | The exact component `type` strings and `value` schemas were **not** obtained | ⚠️ **KNOWN-UNKNOWN — not guessed** | These require a real captured rule. The new "Flows" builder on this instance resisted a scripted save (React-gated button, likely a different backend than the classic `pro/rest`), and `ruleTemplates` carries only metadata, not component internals. **Deliberately not fabricated** — inventing them would repeat the error behind R1 and #8. Path forward: build ONE rule by hand in the UI (≈2 min), then `GET` it back over the internal API to template the other six. |
| 79 | No automation rule was left on OPS by this probing | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | The scripted save never completed; rule count on OPS is 0. No cleanup needed. |

## ITSM escalation fix — 2026-07-20

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 80 | The `/workflows/update` API needs UUID status references and top-level status defs | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Same UUID quirk as create (#8c): numeric `statusReference` → "not a UUID". Fixed by remapping every ref to a stable uuid5 and supplying the numeric `id` alongside. `payload.statuses` must list every referenced status; an ADD-only change needs no status-migration mapping. |
| 81 | ITSM Incident and Problem workflows now carry the escalation path | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Both updated to version 5. `Escalate to L2` (gate), `Escalate - major incident` (role 10049, no validators), `Accept at L2`, and Resolve extended from Escalated. Gate reads back as `system:validate-field-value` on both. |
| 82 | ITSM reseeded through the new path; history coherent | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | 420 issues, 0 off-target, 158/158 escalated with gate evidence. 80/80 sampled tier-L2 Incident/Problem have `Escalated to L2` in history (was 0/100). The seeder's hardcoded edge graph and the escalated-at-pre-escalation-status artifact were both fixed. |
| 83 | The reseed never touched OPS | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `fixtures.jsm_seed --reset` asserts `PROJECT != OPS` and runs `guard_ops` (420 issues, 4 types, scheme name) before and after every phase. OPS confirmed 420/171/171 after. |


## React control tower — 2026-07-20

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 84 | The control tower runs as a React app on localhost | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `webapp/` (Vite + React, built with bun) renders at `http://localhost:5173`, proxying `/api` to `app/server.py` on 8000. `bun run build` compiles clean (33 modules, 154 KB). Live DOM check: all 7 panels render, no console errors. |
| 85 | The React figures match the reference implementation | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | The scoreboard tiles read 61.8% / 40.7% / 4.3% / 78.9% / 96.6% / 60 — identical to `app/metrics.py` and the static tower, because all three consume `app/analytics.build_model`. |
| 86 | No Jira token reaches the browser | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `app/server.py` holds the token and serves computed JSON; the React app only fetches `/api/tower`. The browser never calls Jira. The API is read-only — no endpoint mutates. |


## Automation rules — deeper discovery, 2026-07-20 (later)

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 87 | Real trigger `type` strings are known (not guessed) | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Extracted from `ruleTemplates` `trigger.types`: `jira.issue.field.changed` (rule 1), `jira.issue.event.trigger:transitioned` (2/5/6), `jira.jql.scheduled` (4/7), `jira.issue.event.trigger:created` (3), `jira.manual.trigger.issue`. Authoritative source, not training. |
| 88 | `jira.issue.comment` is a valid action; the manual trigger validates with `value:null` | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | With the manual trigger, a comment action returns a *field-level* error ("Please provide at least one valid value" for `comment`) — proof the type is recognised. Invalid types return a generic "systems are unavailable". |
| 89 | Component **value schemas** are obtainable by capturing one UI-built rule and reading it back | ✅ **VERIFIED 2026-07-20** — earlier pessimism corrected | The API *error channel* is too noisy to walk, but the clean path works: build one rule in the Flows UI (the missing piece was that the flow needs a **name** to persist), then `GET .../rule/{id}` returns the canonical `ruleConfigBean`. Captured the `jira.issue.event.trigger:transitioned` trigger value and the `jira.issue.edit` action value (SET a select field by NAME). |
| 90 | The new "Flows" builder cannot be driven by the browser tools here | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | It holds a live connection and never reaches `document_idle`, so `screenshot`, `find` and `read_page` all time out; a scripted "Save and enable" is React-gated and does not persist (rule count stays 0). A human can use it trivially — it is hostile to *automation*, not to a person. |
| 91 | No automation rule was created on OPS by any of this probing | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Rule count on OPS is 0 after all probes. Nothing to clean up. |

## Automation rules — built, 2026-07-20 (later still)

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 92 | Automation rules CAN be created over the internal API from a captured template | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | `POST .../pro/rest/10034/rule` with the **full** rule wrapper (ruleScope, ruleHome, actor…) copied from a captured rule → 200. A minimal envelope returns the useless "systems are unavailable". `automation/schema/example-transition-edit.rule.json` is the real captured template. |
| 93 | Three rules are live on OPS, all disabled | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Reopen handling, SLA pause on Pending, Route on escalation — created by `automation/build_rules.py` (idempotent), all `DISABLED` so they never rewrite the seeded tickets. Rule count 3. |
| 94 | Building the rules did not touch OPS data | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Disabled rules do not fire. OPS remains 420 / 171 tier-L2 / 171 gate evidence after. |
| 95 | Four rules remain, blocked only on more component captures | ⚠️ **KNOWN, unblocked** | Derive-priority (field-changed trigger + if-else), major-incident alert (send-notification), breach warning (scheduled + comment), auto-close (scheduled + transition). Each needs one UI capture + GET, then a line in `build_rules.py` — the procedure is proven, not speculative. |


## Automation rules — scoped and enabled, 2026-07-20 (final)

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 96 | Transition-trigger status scoping uses `{"type":"NAME","value":"<status>"}` | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Captured by editing the Reopen rule in the UI (From Resolved → To Triage) and reading it back. Same NAME-based shape as edit-action field values. |
| 97 | Three rules are live, ENABLED and correctly scoped | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Reopen handling (Resolved→Triage), SLA pause on Pending (→Pending Customer/Vendor), Route on escalation (→Escalated to L2). Read back over the API: all `ENABLED` with the right `toStatus`. Reproducible via `automation/build_rules.py`. |
| 98 | Enabling did not alter the seeded data | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-20 | Enabled rules fire only on *future* transitions, not retroactively. OPS unchanged: 420 / 171 tier-L2 / 171 gate evidence / 15 reopened. Nothing transitions in a static instance, so nothing has fired. |
| 99 | Four rules remain, each blocked on one UI component capture | ⚠️ **KNOWN, unblocked** | Derive-priority (field-changed trigger + if-else matrix), major-incident alert (send-notification), SLA breach warning (scheduled trigger + comment), auto-close (scheduled trigger + transition). The scheduled two will *mutate* data when they run (auto-close closes stale Resolved tickets; breach warning comments), so they are deliberately left for a decision on whether to run them against the demo snapshot. |


## Automation rules — all seven built and enabled, 2026-07-21

The four rules left in #95/#99 (now **SUPERSEDED**) are built and enabled. They did not
need a UI capture after all: the Flows builder still freezes the CDP-driven renderer on
save, so the component **value schemas** were discovered a different, fully reliable way —
by *empirical round-trip* against the internal API (POST a candidate `value`, `GET` the
canonical shape the server normalises to, `DELETE` the probe). Method + shapes are in
`automation/schema/component-schemas.md`.

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | Component value schemas are discoverable over the API without the UI | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Round-trip probing yielded canonical shapes for the scheduled trigger (`schedule.cronExpression`), created trigger (`eventKey`/`issueEvent`), comment (plain-string `comment`), transition (`destinationStatus` NAME), field condition (`jira.issue.condition`) and the IF block (`jira.condition.container.block`). Each confirmed by GET-back with the value intact. |
| 101 | All seven automation rules are live on OPS and ENABLED | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `POST .../rules` lists 7, every one `ENABLED`: Reopen handling, SLA pause on Pending, Route on escalation, Derive priority from Impact×Urgency, Major incident alert, SLA breach warning, Auto-close resolved tickets. Reproducible via `automation/build_rules.py`. |
| 102 | The priority-derivation rule encodes the full 3×3 matrix | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Read back: created trigger + 9 `jira.condition.container.block` branches, 36 total component nodes. Each branch gates on Impact **and** Urgency (by NAME) and sets Priority to the matrix value. Matches `shared/domain.PRIORITY_MATRIX` and the exact instance priority names ("P1 - Critical" …). |
| 103 | ENABLED validation is stricter than DISABLED and was satisfied deliberately | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Enabling forces server-side resolution the DISABLED round-trip skips: created trigger needs `eventKey`/`issueEvent` populated; scheduled needs `schedule.method:"CRON"`; a **priority** condition's `compareValue` must be by **ID**, a **select** field's by **NAME**. All four rules create `ENABLED` (200), so all passed. |
| 104 | Building/enabling the four rules did not alter the seeded snapshot | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | OPS unchanged after: 420 total, 171 tier-L2. The created-trigger rules fire only on future creates; the two scheduled rules' JQL was written to match **0** of the freshly-seeded rows now (everything `updated` today, so `updated <= -Nd` selects nothing) while staying correct going forward. Verified 0 matches via `search/approximate-count`. |
| 105 | The two scheduled rules WILL drift the snapshot over the coming days | ⚠️ KNOWN / by design | Auto-close (`status = Resolved AND updated <= -7d`, daily 02:00) will close the 39 currently-Resolved tickets about a week out; SLA breach warning (open P1/P2 `updated <= -1d`, daily 08:00) will start commenting tomorrow. This is what "enable" means and was explicitly authorised. Mitigation is the existing rehearsal path: `fixtures.reset` + reseed resets every `updated` to today, so a pre-demo reseed restores the snapshot. |
| 106 | Two component sub-shapes remain UI-only; the rules use verified equivalents | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | The field-changed trigger's per-field `fields[]` and the outgoing-email `to[]` recipients resolve entities server-side and 500 on every constructed shape. So priority-derivation fires on **create** (not field-change) and the major-incident alert posts an **in-issue comment** (not an email). Both are honest, working substitutes; swapping in the field-changed trigger / Send-email action is a one-step UI edit, noted in each rule's description. |


## Automation rules — the two substitutes upgraded to faithful equivalents, 2026-07-21

Following "fix and yes to all", the two rules that had used weaker stand-ins were rebuilt to
match the design intent, still entirely over the API and still ENABLED. #106 is **REFINED**
by these: the substitutes are now faithful equivalents, and the reason is sharper — it is not
that two *sub-shapes* are UI-only, it is that the whole `jira.issue.field.changed` trigger
cannot be *enabled* over the API and the outgoing-email `to[]` recipient 500s on every value.

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 107 | Rule 1 now re-derives Priority on every edit, not only at create | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Rebuilt on `jira.issue.event.trigger:updated` (fires on any work-item edit). Read back: trigger `…:updated`, 9 `container.block` branches / 36 nodes, ENABLED. The matrix conditions gate each branch, so Priority re-derives whenever Impact or Urgency changes — the behaviour the field-changed trigger would give, which itself 500s on enable over the API. `canOtherRuleTrigger=false` and the edit is idempotent, so no self-loop. |
| 108 | Rule 3 now notifies the Major Incident Manager, not just comments | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Rebuilt as created-trigger + condition(Priority=P1 - Critical) + `jira.issue.assign` to the MIM's accountId + comment. Read back: assign action stores `assignType:SPECIFY_USER, assignee:{type:ID,value:<accountId>}`, ENABLED. Assigning fires Jira's notification-scheme email to the assignee — a real notification — since the outgoing-email `to[]` shape 500s on every constructed value. |
| 109 | All seven remain ENABLED and OPS is still the known-good snapshot | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | After the rebuild: 7 rules, 7 ENABLED. OPS 420 total, 171 tier-L2 — unchanged. The two rebuilt rules fire only on future create/edit events, so nothing retroactive; the two scheduled rules' JQL still matches 0 seeded rows. |


## Automation rules — adversarial verification pass, 2026-07-21

An 8-agent workflow re-verified all seven rules against their design (5 PASS, 3 CONCERN).
The matrix was confirmed correct in all 9 cells; no rule-to-rule cascade or self-loop exists
(`canOtherRuleTrigger=false` on all seven, and the matrix edit is idempotent). Two concerns
were real and are now fixed; one is a correction to an earlier over-claim.

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 110 | The "scheduled JQL matches 0 seeded rows" safety (#104/#105) was point-in-time and has decayed | ⚠️ **CORRECTED** | The `updated <= -Nd` windows are *relative*; the seed is a *static* snapshot. ~24h after seeding, the SLA-breach JQL now matches real seeded tickets (9 after the Pending fix below), and its next 08:00 run will comment on them. Auto-close (`updated <= -7d`) still matches 0 and will begin closing week-old Resolved tickets on a rolling basis. Enabling was non-retroactive (verified: OPS still 420/171); the drift is the authorised forward behaviour, and a pre-demo reseed (`fixtures.reset` + reseed) resets every `updated` to today and restores the inert snapshot. |
| 111 | Rule 1 conditions now bind Impact/Urgency by field ID, closing a silent-no-op trap | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `Urgency` exists twice (`customfield_10044` populated, `customfield_10071` empty) so a NAME reference could bind to the empty field and never match. Rebuilt: all 9 branches' `selectedField` read back as `{"type":"ID","value":"customfield_10004"}` (Impact) and `…10044` (Urgency), resolved from `.build_state.json`. Same duplicate-name hazard `shared/fields.py` handles. |
| 112 | Rule 4 no longer warns on paused-SLA tickets | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | JQL now excludes `status in ("Pending Customer","Pending Vendor")` — where the resolution SLA is legitimately paused by rule 5 — dropping the match set from 11 to 9. Read back live. |
| 113 | Rule 1 co-fires with transitions but is safe | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Because it uses the generic issue-updated trigger, a human transition (escalate/pause/reopen) also re-runs the matrix on that ticket. Not a cascade (`canOtherRuleTrigger=false`); both rules match the one event. Effect is a benign idempotent re-derive — seeded priorities already equal the matrix — but it will overwrite a *manually* off-matrix Priority on the next edit, which is the intended "priority is a derivation, not a negotiation" behaviour. |


## React control tower on GitHub Pages — 2026-07-21

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 114 | The React control tower can be hosted on GitHub Pages aligned with Jira, with no token in the browser | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `app/export_pages.py` bakes the `app/control_tower.build_model` output to `webapp/public/data/*.json` (6 files: OPS/ITSM × 30/90/180 + index.json); `.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs it in CI with the token as a repo secret, builds, and deploys. The browser only fetches the static JSON. "Real time" = refreshed on the cron schedule, not live-on-load — a static host cannot hold the token and Jira Cloud blocks direct browser calls (CORS). |
| 115 | The static-mode build renders every panel from the baked JSON | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `VITE_DATA_MODE=static bun run build` → 33 modules, data bundled into `dist/data/`. Served via `vite preview` and loaded in-browser: masthead, all six scoreboard tiles (FTR 62.0% / esc 40.6% / reopen 4.3% / res-SLA 78.8% / resp-SLA 96.6%), analyst band, KB gap 79/170, etc. all render; OPS↔ITSM toggle refetches the right file (419 vs 420 in window); zero console errors; freshness stamp shows the generated_at time. |
| 116 | The baked payload carries no real PII, and the CI job needs no pip install | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Regex scan of the OPS payload found zero email addresses; analyst names are synthetic (N. Haddad, K. Yamamoto, …). An AST walk of the whole export chain (export_pages → store → control_tower → analytics → jira_client → fields → domain) found no non-stdlib, non-local import, so the workflow runs `python3 -m app.export_pages` with no dependency install. |

An adversarial review workflow (4 agents) over the Pages deployment found **no blockers**;
its findings were applied:

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 117 | The FTR-vs-reopen scatter now renders (was a dead panel) | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Pre-existing key mismatch: `webapp/src/charts.jsx` read `p.ftr`/`p.reopen` but the model keys them `ftr_pct`/`reopen_pct`, so the filter emptied and the panel always showed "not enough weeks" (in both api and static modes). Fixed to read the canonical keys; in-browser check now shows the scatter (14 weekly points, no fallback), 7/7 panels render, zero console errors. Corrects the "all render" wording of #115. |
| 118 | CI builds are reproducible and self-enable Pages | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Workflow switched from `npm install` (no committed lockfile) to `bun install --frozen-lockfile` against the committed `webapp/bun.lock`, matching local dev; `actions/configure-pages@v5` set `enablement: true` so a first run self-enables Pages. `export_pages.py` now calls `require_env()` and wraps each project so one failure still emits `index.json` and the site still deploys. |


## Pages live-setup + drillable charts + more metrics — 2026-07-21

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 119 | The repo is public, Pages is enabled, and refresh is daily | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `gh repo view` → visibility PUBLIC; `gh api repos/…/pages` → build_type `workflow`, url `https://singhaditya21.github.io/JIRADemo/`. Before making public, a full-history scan (git pickaxe on the token value = 0 commits; 171 blobs scanned, 0 secret-pattern matches; `settings.local.json` never tracked) confirmed no secret is exposed. `JIRA_SITE`/`JIRA_EMAIL` secrets set; the cron is `0 6 * * *`. Only `JIRA_TOKEN` remains for the user — the last CI run stopped cleanly at "Missing environment variables: … JIRA_TOKEN". |
| 120 | The tower now shows 11 panels — 4 new metric panels from previously-unused model data | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Added SLA outcomes (`sla_detail`), Backlog & flow (`backlog` + weekly created/closed/net), Channel quality (`channel_quality`), and Ageing owned-vs-paused (`ageing_by_status`) — all data `app/analytics.py` already computed but the UI never surfaced. In-browser check: 11 `.panel` headings render, zero console errors. No change to the analytics core. |
| 121 | Every chart is drillable, with valid Jira deep links | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `src/drill.jsx` Drawer + `onPick` on every chart primitive. In-browser: clicking a scoreboard tile, a tower row, a channel row, an SLA row, an ageing band, and a backlog point each opens the right detail drawer; Escape and overlay-click close it. Every drill's JQL was checked against Jira `search/approximate-count` — all valid (0 400s); e.g. the FTR link matches 217, tower "End User Computing" 126, channel Portal 198. JQL uses `cf[<id>]` clause names so duplicate field names (Urgency) don't misresolve. |


## Control tower — tier lenses + filled layout — 2026-07-21

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 122 | The tower has an Overview / L1 / L2 tier lens that reshapes the board | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Header switcher (`lensPanels()` in App.jsx). In-browser per lens: Overview = 6-metric KPI strip + 10 panels; L1 = front-line queue, Response SLA (L1 clock), FTR↔reopen, analysts, KB coverage, channel, intake; L2 = L2 WIP queue, Resolution SLA (L2 clock), KB debt, why-work-escalates, towers, ageing owned/paused, backlog. An always-on tier-aware KPI strip carries the headline numbers. |
| 123 | The tier split works on both OPS and ITSM despite different workflows | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Statuses bucket L1/L2/waiting by name (`tierOf()`), not a hard-coded list. Classified live: OPS L1=23/L2=18/wait=21; ITSM (Open/Work in progress/Implementing/Awaiting CAB approval/…) L1=19/L2=35/wait=57. In-browser ITSM+L2 renders 8 status bars, Open-at-L2 = 35 — no empty queues. |
| 124 | The layout now fills the screen | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Was `main{max-width:1180px}` (centered, ~500px wasted on a 1680px screen) + 2-up grid. Now `max-width:min(97vw,1760px)` + `grid auto-fill minmax(380px,1fr)`: at 1680px the content uses 1630px (50px margin), grid is 3-up, KPI strip fills full width. |
| 125 | Two new panels + three new drill types, all with valid Jira links | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | New panels: Front-line/L2 queue (`QueueByStatus`) and Why-work-escalates (`EscalationReasons`, from `kb.by_reason`). New drills: `statusgroup` (Open-at-L1/L2 → count per status), `reason` (escalation reason → `cf[10046]`), `kbgap`. All JQL validated: statusgroup-L1 → 23, statusgroup-L2 → 18, reason "Suspected platform defect" → 33. Zero console errors; empty aged-14d KPI sparkline suppressed. |


## Roadmap execution — the record-level drill (Now/Next keystone) — 2026-07-21

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 126 | The bake now emits a record-level dataset, exactly reconciling with the aggregates | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `app/export_pages.py` fetches with changelog and writes `{project}-records.json` (~600 KB, all issues as flat rows + the population booleans + a compact changelog timeline), and adds `window_start_ts`/`now_ts` to each model. Filtering records by window + the same booleans app/analytics uses reproduces every aggregate: OPS-90 records-in-window 418 = volume; FTR 215/347, escalation 170/418, reopen 15, kb_gap 79 — all exact. |
| 127 | Every chart drills to the actual Jira records in a right-side multi-column panel | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `webapp/src/drill.jsx`: a wide right-side drawer with Layer (a) aggregate context, Layer (c) a 13-column record LIST (sortable, per-row Jira link, a numerator toggle e.g. "only breached (82)") and Layer (d) single-record detail (full field set + the status-transition timeline built from the changelog). Records lazy-load once per project and cache. In-browser: Resolution SLA → 387 rows "matches 387 ✓"; a row → OPS-2300 detail with New→Triage→In Progress L1 timeline + Jira link. |
| 128 | The record list reconciles with the mark it opened from | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Each drill declares a record predicate keyed to the same booleans/fields; the list footer asserts `count === num/den` and shows ✓ or a warning. Verified live across drill types: FTR den 347 ✓, Resolution SLA 387 ✓ (breached 82 ✓), KB gap 79 ✓, KB-by-tower 25 ✓, KB-gap-by-reason 19 ✓, Open-at-L2 18 ✓, single status 16 ✓, tower 126 ✓, channel 196 ✓. Fixed a real mislabel found this way: the "why work escalates" panel was actually KB-gap-by-reason (sums to 79, not all escalations) — relabelled "KB gaps by reason" and the drill/JQL corrected. |
| 129 | The public records files carry no secret and no real PII | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Scan of both `*-records.json`: no token, no email addresses; analyst names are synthetic seed values (A. Okafor, …); no reporter/assignee accounts. A `PSEUDONYMISE_ANALYSTS=1` bake flag masks analyst names to "Analyst NN" for a real deployment (roadmap privacy item). Records are gitignored; CI regenerates them on each deploy. |


## Roadmap execution batch 2 — insights, revived themes, cohort layer — 2026-07-21

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 130 | The insights engine is live — verdicts computed by analytics are read out as prose | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `InsightsFeed` (panels.jsx) generates worst-first narrative from the same figures the panels show: gap/pass verdicts vs targets, KB-gap lever, backlog staling, #1 pilot tower, criterion-6 (analysts vs 2σ), the FTR↔reopen r, and week-over-week escalation delta. In-browser: 11 insights, e.g. "First-time resolution is 62.0% against a ≥65% target — 3.0 pts short"; each clickable insight drills to the records. Moves Part VI from 0→live. |
| 131 | Three dead OPS themes are revived + the integrity strip | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Impact×Urgency heatmap (theme J, 3×3 with derived priority, cell drills to the 42 High/High → P1 records), Major-incident panel (theme K: 42 P1 total / 6 open / 36 resolved, drills with an "only still open" toggle), the backlog **aged-climbing line** added beside open (theme D signature), and a Data-integrity strip surfacing `jira_time_counterexample` (1 distinct created date → why the tower trends on Reported At), the reconciliation guarantee, and the warnings count. All computed from the record layer / model — no analytics change. |
| 132 | The drill is now the full four-layer model — cohort small-multiples added | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Layer (b): between the aggregate context and the record list, the drawer now renders small-multiples of the population sliced by tower / priority / status / channel (`Cohort` in drill.jsx, from the filtered records). In-browser the FTR drill shows 4 cohort dimensions above its 347-row list. Completes ROADMAP Part III (aggregate → cohort → record list → single record). |
| 133 | "Fill the width" addressed — grid auto-fit | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | The panel grid switched from `auto-fill` to `auto-fit` so tracks collapse and panels stretch edge-to-edge with no trailing gaps; at 1500px it renders 3-up with the content filling the container. |


## Roadmap execution batch 3 — real ITSM ITIL charts + tier-flow — 2026-07-21

The audit's largest gap was ~39 NOT-live ITIL charts. These are now built for the ITSM
project from the record layer (client-side, verified by the record drill), and only where
the instance has the data — CSAT is deliberately NOT built (no satisfaction field on the
record) rather than faked.

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 134 | The ITSM project now renders ITIL-native panels, distinct from OPS | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `lensPanels` is project-aware: ITSM Overview shows ITIL practice mix, Incident management (MTTA 2.8h / MTTR 24.5h / 270 incidents / 29 P1 / 55 open), Change management (by status incl. CAB-pending), Problem management + root-cause breakdown, Service request fulfilment (+ approvals pending), and SLA attainment by work type; OPS keeps tier-flow / Impact×Urgency / major-incident. All computed from `ITSM-records.json` (issue_type, response_hours, resolved_at, root_cause, resolution_sla, approval statuses). |
| 135 | The new ITIL drills reconcile to the panel numbers | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Generic `records` drill type carries each panel's predicate + JQL; footer asserts count===target. Live: practice-mix Incident → 270 ✓, a change status → 21 ✓, a root cause → 46 ✓, SLA-by-type Incident → 215 ✓. Every ITIL drill deep-links to Jira (issuetype / status / cf[10048] root cause / cf[10051] SLA). |
| 136 | Honest gaps are stated, not faked | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | CSAT/CES is not built — the record has no satisfaction field. CAB *cycle time* is not built — approval timestamps aren't on the record (the panel says so). Problem→incident links aren't built — issue links aren't on the record. Each absence is labelled in the relevant panel rather than fabricated. |
| 137 | OPS tier-flow / ping-pong (theme D) is live from the changelog | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `TierFlow` reads each ticket's status timeline: 263 clean (0 tier hops), 0 ping-pong (a bounce back to an *active* L1 status), 0 re-escalated (a second escalation *event*), with a tier-hop distribution that drills to records. A first pass over-counted both (terminal Resolved/Closed mis-read as "L1", and "In Progress L2" mis-read as a re-escalation); fixed by classifying terminal states as done and counting only transitions *into* L2 *from* a non-L2 status. The clean seed genuinely has no ping-pong; the metric would surface it if present. |


## Roadmap execution batch 4 — cross-filter, export, shareable views — 2026-07-21

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 138 | The drill supports cross-filtering — cohort → record list | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Cohort small-multiples (layer b) are now clickable: clicking a bar adds a filter to the record list below, shown as a removable chip. In-browser: the FTR drill's "by tower" bar narrowed the list to "105 of 347 records" with a "tower: End User Computing ✕" chip; removing it restored 347. The reconciliation footer suppresses its ✓ while narrowed (the subset is not meant to equal the denominator). Completes ROADMAP Part III's cross-filter. |
| 139 | The record list sorts and exports | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Every column header sorts (asc/desc toggle — "Age ↑" verified). Two export actions: "copy keys" (issue keys to clipboard, for a Jira `key in (…)` query) and "CSV ⬇" (the current filtered/sorted/column view as CSV). Part VII export. |
| 140 | Any view is a shareable, bookmarkable URL | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Board state lives in the URL hash `#/PROJECT/LENS/DAYS`, parsed on load and kept in sync as controls change. In-browser: opening `#/ITSM/L2/90` booted straight into ITSM + L2; switching to OPS/Overview rewrote the hash to `#/OPS/overview/90`. Enables Part VII saved-views/sharing without a backend. Zero console errors; token absent from bundle. |


## Roadmap execution batch 5 — "build this": gate confirmation + honest change depth — 2026-07-21

The three "genuinely remaining" items were probed empirically before building. Two of the
three turned out to be already-done or not-derivable-from-this-seed; the buildable, honest
subset was shipped rather than a fabricated metric.

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 141 | The escalation gate is already enforced (the earlier "not enforced" audit note was wrong) | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | OPS transition **"Escalate to L2"** carries one validator `system:validate-field-value`, ruleType `fieldRequired`, `fieldsRequired = customfield_10046,customfield_10055,customfield_10047` (Escalation reason / Escalation notes / KB checked) with the design's error message — read back from the live workflow. **"Escalate - major incident"** deliberately carries 0 field validators (MIM speed path, role-gated instead). So "enforce the gate" needed no build; the record is corrected here. |
| 142 | Change management now shows real lead time + CAB governance coverage (not a fabricated cycle time) | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Probing the changelog showed every Change ticket's status transitions bear the **same bake-time timestamp** — the seed records status *order* honestly but collapses per-transition wall-clock, so a "CAB dwell time" would compute to a misleading ~0.0h. That metric is deliberately NOT shown. What IS real is shipped: **lead time** median 2.4d (raised→resolved, from genuinely-seeded dates) and **CAB-reviewed** 22/29 = 76% (governance coverage: did the change pass through the "Awaiting CAB approval" gate — a sequence fact), plus CAB-pending 4 / declined 2. Statuses sum to 29; CAB-pending 4 = "Awaiting CAB approval" bar 4. Supersedes the CAB-cycle caveat in #136. |
| 143 | Off-target alerting runs in CI from the baked scoreboard | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `app/alerts.py` reads the baked `{project}-{days}.json` scoreboards (no Jira call, no secret) and reports every KPI with a `GAP` verdict, worst-first, reusing the verdicts analytics.py already computed (so CI and dashboard can't disagree). Local run over the 90-day bake surfaces 9 breaches — e.g. "OPS · Resolution SLA is 78.8% against a ≥95% target — 16.2 pts short", "ITSM · Aged > 14 days is 105" — plus the Urgency data-warning in a details block. Warn-only by default (exit 0); `--fail-on-breach` exits 1 for a real deployment. Wired into `pages.yml` after the bake, writing to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` so a scheduled run flags the desk off-target with no dashboard, no token, no polling. |


## "Build this" batch — CSAT (modelled proxy) — 2026-07-21

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 144 | CSAT ships as a transparently-modelled proxy, never faked as a survey | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | This instance has no satisfaction field, so rather than create a Jira field and launder invented scores through it (which would also need the user's token), the score is derived in `app/export_pages._csat_rating` from resolution SLA + reopening + response speed + a deterministic per-key jitter (so it is not SLA re-encoded), and every surface labels it **"Modelled proxy — not a survey."** The `CustomerSatisfaction` panel (ITSM Overview + L1) shows avg 4.17, 84% satisfied (4–5★), 4% dissatisfied, 277 responses, a full 1–5 distribution (107/125/33/10/2 = 277 ✓, drillable), and an honesty cut — "satisfied despite SLA breach" 4 / "dissatisfied despite SLA met" 0 — the independent signal a real survey would add over the clock. Verified in-browser on ITSM Overview. The user explicitly authorised the fabrication after being shown the caveat. |
| 145 | The near-real-time backend is deployable — app is wired for a live backend, not just static | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `app/server.py` grew a live `GET /api/records` (reusing the exact bake row-builder `app.export_pages._record`, so live and static rows can't drift), CORS preflight, and `$HOST`/`$PORT` binding for a PaaS. The frontend reads `VITE_API_BASE` — `dataUrl`/`recordsUrl` hit the remote backend in api mode, the static files otherwise. Shipped a `Dockerfile` (stdlib, tiny), `.dockerignore`, `render.yaml` blueprint (Jira secrets `sync:false`, never committed), and `webapp/DEPLOY-BACKEND.md` (deploy → set token on host → flip Pages build to `VITE_DATA_MODE=api`+`VITE_API_BASE`). Verified: `import app.server` OK; static build unchanged; api-mode build bakes the backend URL into the bundle. The only step that needs the user is hosting the backend with their token (a credential the assistant must not handle); everything else is built. |
| 146 | Snapshot-history trends — headline KPIs tracked deploy-over-deploy | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `app/export_pages` appends one dated point per project per run to `{project}-history.json` (date-keyed, no run timestamp → a same-day re-run is a byte-identical no-op; capped at 180 points). `pages.yml` gained `contents: write` and a change-gated commit-back (`git diff --cached --quiet` guard, `[skip ci]`, GITHUB_TOKEN push doesn't re-trigger) so history accumulates run-over-run. The `SnapshotTrends` panel (Overview, both projects) renders a direction-aware sparkline per KPI. Verified in-browser both states: the real single point shows "Building history: 1 snapshot so far · first point" on all 6 cards; a throwaway 5-point OPS history (test-only, reverted) drew the sparklines with correct deltas and direction-aware colour — FTR ▲0.8 pts green, Escalation ▼0.3 pts green (down is good), Aged ▼2 green, unchanged KPIs neutral. The committed history holds exactly one real point (2026-07-21) per project; it fills going forward, no fabricated past. |
| 147 | Problem→incident links are real Jira links, read end-to-end, with a graceful pre-link state | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `jira_config/link_problems.py` creates REAL Jira links (idempotent, --dry-run, deterministic) — each Problem is linked via the instance's causal link type to Incidents in its tower, root-cause matches first. Offline verification against the seed: 13 Problems → 83 links, 0 incident reused, 83/83 same-tower, 37/83 root-cause matched, per-problem 5–8. `app/store` now reads `issuelinks` (new `_parse_links`, `links` Issue attr — round-trips through the cache serializer, verified) and the bake emits `links` per record. `ProblemManagement` gained an **incident footprint** section: with links it shows problems-with-links / incidents-linked / avg + top problems (drill "Incidents caused by ITSM-1282" → 8 records ✓, JQL `issue in linkedIssues(...)`); without links (the committed state) it shows a clear "no links yet — run the linker" hint. Both states verified in-browser (injected test links reverted). A `workflow_dispatch` Action ("Link ITSM problems to incidents") runs the linker with the CI secret, **defaulting to dry-run** so writing to Jira is a deliberate opt-in — the only step that needs the user, and it never handles the token in a terminal. |
| 148 | The 83 Problem→Incident links are created live and rendering on the deployed site | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | Ran the "Link ITSM problems to incidents" Action twice: a dry-run rehearsal in real CI (discovered the instance's **Problem/Incident** link type — outward "causes" / inward "is caused by" — planned 83 pairs across 13 problems, all `[dry]`), then a real run (`linker mode: APPLY`, 0 `[dry]` lines, `done: 83 link(s) created, 0 already present`). A Pages rebake then surfaced them: the deployed `ITSM-records.json` carries 83 problem-side links (all 13 problems) with the reverse "is caused by" on 83 incidents; the live footprint panel shows 13 problems / 83 incidents / avg 6.4, and the drill "Incidents caused by ITSM-1282" → 8 records with the real linked keys. A latent bug was found+fixed en route: the workflow's dry-run gate used a GitHub `${{ == }}` ternary whose type coercion defaulted the *real* run back to dry-run (fail-safe, so nothing leaked); moved the decision to a deterministic bash string-compare on the interpolated value. |
| 149 | Near-real-time is turnkey (one repo variable) and the backend is boot-verified | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-21 | `pages.yml` flips to api mode automatically when repo Variable `VITE_API_BASE` is set (`${{ vars.VITE_API_BASE != '' && 'api' || 'static' }}`) — empty ⇒ static (safe default), so no YAML edit is needed to enable near-real-time; DEPLOY-BACKEND.md documents the one-variable flow. Boot smoke test (dummy creds, no Jira): `/api/health` → 200 `{ok:true}`; OPTIONS preflight → 204 with correct CORS (ACAO `*`, methods GET/OPTIONS); `/api/tower` with bad creds → graceful 500 JSON (server stays up); unknown project → 400; health still 200 after errors. The only irreducible user steps are hosting the backend and providing the Jira token — a credential the assistant must never handle. |
| 150 | Adversarial audit of the links + backend: 4 low findings, all resolved | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-22 | A 5-lens workflow (live-links, linker-code, backend, docs, integrity) with per-finding adversarial verification found the backend + docs lenses clean and 4 low-severity issues, now fixed: (a) **link direction** — the deployed JSON's `rel`/`dir` read "Incident causes Problem". Read-only `--inspect` proved the 83 **Jira links are actually correct** (on the Problem the Incident sits under `inwardIssue`, i.e. Problem is the outward/"causes" party); the bug was in `store._parse_links`, which labeled from the wrong perspective. Fixed the mapping (no Jira mutation); deployed JSON now reads Problem-side `causes`/outward ×83, Incident-side `is caused by`/inward ×83. (b) **shell injection** — the `per_problem` workflow input was interpolated into a token-bearing bash step; now every input is passed via `env:` and referenced as a shell var, `per_problem` validated as an integer. (c) **link direction hardcoded** — linker now places the Problem on whichever side carries the active "causes" label (`causer_is_outward`), robust to a nonstandard type. (d) **tracked state files** — confirmed **clean of secrets** (only Jira object-ID mappings); no action. The frontend footprint panel was correct throughout (it keys off neighbour issue_type, not rel/dir). Bonus: snapshot history now carries two dated points (07-21, 07-22), confirming day-over-day accrual + CI commit-back. |


## Roadmap push — Batch A: Insights & Intelligence layer (Part VI) — 2026-07-22

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |

| 151 | The insights layer gained six model-driven intelligence panels | ✅ VERIFIED 2026-07-22 | New in panels.jsx, wired into the Overview lens (both projects), all rendering with zero console errors: **Tower league** (gap-to-best vs the internal benchmark, metric-switchable SLA/FTR/Escalation — verified live: Network&Connectivity best SLA 81.8%, switch to FTR recomputes to Compute&Storage 24.8-pt gap); **What changed** (day-over-day digest from the committed snapshots — "No material change since 2026-07-21" today, fills as deltas appear); **Anomaly watch** (weekly moves >1.75σ of each metric's own delta-volatility — caught Response SLA −13.2 pts / 3.0σ); **Recommended next actions** (4 prescriptive, drillable — KB gap, worst-SLA tower vs best, aged tail, escalation gap); **Forecast** (least-squares trend over complete weeks, 4-wk projection + weeks-to-target — SLA 80%→87.3%, off track, 13wk); **Pilot exit scorecard** (6 criteria computed live, 3/6 met). Moves Part VI from 17% up materially; addresses roadmap 6.2/6.3/6.4/6.5/6.8. |
